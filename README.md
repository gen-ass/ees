# Elite Electrical Services
Site was created for client who wanted to connect with clients through an online site. It was necessary for the client to have a form that submit information when a user requested it. The site showcases the type of services the supplier offers.  

### What was used 
The site is build using as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A PHP form was integrated into the site for requesting information. 

### Who was involved
The site was built by me. This included creating the design and developing the site, initialising the site on the server and testing it making sure it complied with user requirements. 

### Continued support
Throughout the lifetime of the site I was required to support customisations, server uptime/downtime and setting up mailboxes for the client.
